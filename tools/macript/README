Macript searches input sources for anything that looks like a macro invocation
(NAME(PARAMS)). It then replaces those invocations with the result of invoking
the corresponding executable with the given arguments, if such an executable
exists in the directory where macript is invoked. Results are sent to standard
output, presumably for piping to a compiler or interpreter.

See "perldoc macript.pl" for more information.
