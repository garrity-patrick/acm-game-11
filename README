This is a collabrative effot by the St. Olaf chapter of the ACM to build a game from scratch.

The main directory contains the immoral engine, our homebrew game engine that will power the game. The test directory holds tests of this engine, and a directory for the game itself will be added. Currently the engine is compiled as a shared object, though this is subject to change.

Dependencies include:
* OpenGL
* GLFW

This project is hosted on github: https://github.com/garrity-patrick/acm-game-11
